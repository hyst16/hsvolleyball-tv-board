# HS Volleyball TV — Office URL Guide

This repository powers the HS Volleyball TV boards. Use the Office URL feature to show a curated list of teams on each TV by visiting a GitHub Pages URL that includes an office key.

Quick start

- Debug / Teams Builder (pick teams, preview JSON):
  https://hyst16.github.io/hsvolleyball-tv-board/debug.html

Full URL format (use your org or username in place of `hyst16`):

https://hyst16.github.io/hsvolleyball-tv-board/?office=<office-key>

Example (clickable):

- [Mead TV — mead-office](https://hyst16.github.io/hsvolleyball-tv-board/?office=mead-office)

How to edit teams (simple)

1) Use the Debug / Teams Builder page to select teams and build a `teams.json` snippet.
2) Click "Copy JSON" and then click the **Edit on GitHub** link to open `teams.json` in the web editor.
3) Paste the updated JSON and commit the change to the `main` branch.

Notes

- Matching is case-insensitive and ignores punctuation; use the NSAA team text (no record) when possible.
- The site refreshes teams automatically when `teams.json` changes.
- If you accidentally create an office key, use the Debug page's **Delete selected office** button and then paste/commit the updated JSON to GitHub.

Troubleshooting

- 404 for debug page: wait a minute and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5). Ensure the site is published from the `main` branch.
- If a team shows as "Missing" in the Debug UI, use the suggested replacement or pick the correct team from the list and update `teams.json`.
